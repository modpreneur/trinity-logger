# trinity-logger
Bundle for storing and loading logs.
Originaly this should be for Amazon's DynamoDB and basic work with it.
But dynamo come with more headache then we could accept.

Now we are developing for elasticSearch. No bundles for work with elasticSearch was stable enough to work with.
Currently base for this bundle is official elasticSearch-php.

This bundle is in early development phase, use on own risk!

Write issue if you found something that doesn't work as it should.
